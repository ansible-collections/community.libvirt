via the [libvirt](https://libvirt.org/) API.

This collection is shipped with the `ansible` package.

- python >= 2.6
- [libvirt python bindings](https://pypi.org/project/libvirt-python/)

## Using this collection
<!--Include some quick examples that cover the most common use cases for your collection content. -->

Before using the libvirt collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.libvirt
```

You can include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: community.libvirt
```

You can also download the tarball from [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/libvirt) and install the collection manually wherever you need.

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy with the command-line tool or tarball, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the Ansible package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.libvirt --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.libvirt:==X.Y.Z
```

See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.
