major_changes:
  - Adde new ansible module base class VirtModule to be used by modules. Almost
    all modules within collection work with libvirt and verify imports, produce
    ansible exit json formatted result text. Use of this class can help to
    standartize modules and bring check and diff support to their results.
  - Purposed ModuleStatus class to form module work results yaml. This is
    dataclass which allows to manage whole json_exit statuses under one object.
    Standartise approach in the modules and minimize amount of class memebers.
  - Added virt_secret module to manipulate libvirt secrets which is based on
    VirtModule class. This is example of the purposed solution and this module
    wasn't present in the collection forcing people to use command and template
    xml files to define secrets. The module is capable to consume both xml and
    secret defined as parameters. So defintion of the secrets could be
    simplified. Module is idempotent, support check and diff mode.
