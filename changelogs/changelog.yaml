    changes:
      major_changes:
      - added generic libvirt inventory plugin

    - 23-inventory.yml
    release_date: '2020-08-18'
  1.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - libvirt_qemu - Mitigate a CPU hammering active wait loop
      - libvirt_qemu - add import error handling
      - virt - Correctly get the error message from libvirt
      - virt - Return "changed" status when using "define" command and domain XML
        was updated
      - virt - The define action searchs for the domain name into the xml definition
        to determine if the domain needs to be created or updated. The xml variable
        contains the parsed definition but doesn't guarantee the existence of the
        name tag. This change targets to fix the scenario where the xml var is not
        empty but doesn't contain a name tag.
      - virt_net - The name parameter is not required for the list_nets or facts command
        so we adjust the module to allow for that.
